## Managing risk of saturation
### Adaptive capacity is finite / boundaries are universal
The location of boundaries to the ability to meet demands is uncertain.

Given a finite range, there is a general parameter - capacity for maneuver (CfM) which specifies how much of the range the unit has used and what capacity reamints to handle upcoming demands.

### Events will produce demands that challenge boundaries on the adaptive capacity of any UAB / Surprise occurs, continuously

There are recurring patterns that characterize model surprise - how events challenge boundaries:

* Events will occur at some rate and of some size and of some kind that increase the risk of saturation - exhausting the remaining CfM
* Brittleness is how rapidly a unit's eprformance declines when it nears and reaches its boundaries.
* The range of adaptive behavior of a UAB is a model of fitness.
* Events that occur near or outside a UAB's boundary increases the risk of stauration, and this occurs independent ofhow well that UAB matches responses to demands.

### Adaptive capacities are regulated to manage the risk of saturating CfM / Risk of saturation is monitored and regulated
* The work required to adapt and handle changing demands increases as CfM decreases.
* As risk of saturation increases and CfM approaches exhaustion, UABs need to adapt to stretch or extend their base range of adaptive behavior to accomodate surprises.

## Network of adaptive units
### No UAB can have sufficient ability to regulate CfM to manage the risk of saturation alone / Synchronization across multiple units of adaptive behavior in a network is necessary

UABs exist in and are defined relative to a network of interacting and interdependent UABs at multiple scales â†’ networks with multiple roles, multiple echelons

### Some UABs monitor and regulate the CfM of other UABs in response to changes in the risk of saturation / Risk of saturation can be shared

Misalignment and mis-coordination across UABs increaes the risk of saturating control as demands grow and cascade.

### Adaptive capacity is the potential for adjusting patterns of action to handle future situations, events, opportunities and disruptions / Pressure changes what is sacrificed when
What architectural properties of the network influence the way units in a network respond to varying pressures on trade-offs?

## Outmaneuvering constraints
### Performance of a UAB as it approaches saturation is different from the performance of that UAB when it operates far from saturation / Pressure for optimality undermines graceful extensibility

### All UABs are local / All adaptive units are local

### There are bounds on the perspective any UAB, but these limits are overcome by shifts and contrasts over multiple perspectives / Perspective contrast overcomes bounds

### Reflective systems risk mis-calibration / Mis-calibration is the norm
